        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>I'm Oda. A designer, team player and problem solver.</h2>
        <p>I have always concidered myself a creative soul, and since i was a child i have been intrigued by computers and technology. I like drawing, painting, knitting, cooking, skiing, hiking and decorating. Front-end is for me the perfect way to combine my passions and interests. As a student, I find myself learning an growing each day.</p>
        <p>The tools I am using in my studies are Figma for design, Git/GitHub for version control, Postman for API calls, and Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p>In addition to the projects listed in my "Work"-page, I also contributed on a collaborative exercise simulating a real work project  facilitated by Noroff. In this project our class of 70 students was assigned to design and develop a  webpage for the volunteer organisation Mozika Manova Fiainana" (Music makes friends). I was one out of ten people on the design team, and we used Figma and FigJam. This was a very interesting experience, and it was fun learning the process of building a website from start in a large team setting.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward to developing new skills in my next year of studies, where we are diving deeper into the coding languages and respective frameworks.</p>
        <p>My long term aspirations are multifaceted. I aim to master advanced frontend technologies like React and Vue.js, and eventually expand my expertise to become a full-stack developer. Contributing to open source projects is a significant goal for me, as it allows for continuous learning and giving back to the community. I am passionate about UX/UI design and intend to specialize in this area to create intuitive and visually appealing applications. Pursuing leadership roles and mentoring fellow developers is another ambition of mine, as I enjoy fostering innovation and collaboration. Ultimately, I aspire to work on impactful projects that make a positive difference in people's lives and stay at the forefront of emerging technologies like WebAssembly and AR. My journey in frontend development is driven by a desire to create meaningful, user-centric web experiences.</p>
        <p>This is one of my favourite quotes (by Astrid Lindgren / Pippi Longstocking):</p>
        <div class="sizing-container">
          <p class="quote">“I have never tried that before, so I think I should definitely be able to do that.”</p>
        </div>
        <p>This resonates so deeply with me because I love to challenge myself, and I prefer to learn by doing.</p>
